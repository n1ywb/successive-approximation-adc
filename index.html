<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>The successive approximation Analog to Digital 
  Converter(ADC)</STRONG> is probably the most common ADC. It requires few 
  parts, and is simple to operate. Also, it always takes exactly the same amount 
  of time to calculate the result. In a nutshell, it consists of a 
  <STRONG>comparator</STRONG>, a <STRONG>digital to analog 
  converter(DAC</STRONG>), and a <STRONG>logic controller</STRONG>. The logic 
  controller uses the DAC to produce a voltage, and checks the output of the 
  comparator to see if it's over or under the unknown voltage. It then makes an 
  adjustment, and checks again. It always takes exactly the number of steps that 
  there are bits of resolution. IE, an 8 bit successive approximation ADC takes 
  8 steps to perform the conversion. A 16 bit ADC takes 16 steps, and so on. To 
  be more specific, the controller first sets the <STRONG>most significant 
  bit(MSB)</STRONG> of the DAC. This generates a voltage that is effectively 
  half of the maximum output voltage. It then checks the output of the 
  comparator. If the comparator indicates that the output of the onboard DAC is 
  greater than the unknown voltage, the controller clears the MSB. Otherwise it 
  keeps the MSB set. Then it sets the second to most significant bit, and 
  performs the same test. Each time that a bit is tested, the ADC gets half-way 
  closer to the unknown voltage. In theory it will never quite get there, but in 
  reality it gets there within our measurable margin of error. <STRONG>Once 
  every bit on the input to the DAC has been tested, the input to the DAC 
  becomes the output from the ADC!</STRONG> In this way, the successive 
  approximation ADC will always arrive at the most precise and accurate sample 
  possible in the same amount of time. 
  <LI><STRONG>The ramp ADC: </STRONG>The older <STRONG>ramp</STRONG> type is no 
  longer used, because it is functionally similar to the successive 
  approximation type, but varies in the amount of time required to capture a 
  sample. A ramp ADC slowly raises the output voltage of it's internal DAC, 
  until the voltage reaches that of the unknown voltage, and the comparator 
  switches, sending a signal to the controller. The input to the DAC is now the 
  output of the ADC. Depending on the level of the unknown voltage, the amount 
  of time it takes for the ramp to reach it can vary widely. A ramp ADC with a 
  smarter logic controller quickly becomes a successive approximation ADC. 
  <LI><STRONG>The flash ADC:</STRONG> The flash ADC consists of lots and lots of 
  comparators, one for each possible output number. IE, if you have an 8 bit 
  flash ADC, it will require 2^8=256 comparators. That may not seem too bad, 
  given modern IC technology. But a 32 bit flash ADC would require 
  <STRONG>2^32=4.3 BILLION comparators!</STRONG> Because of this, the cost of a 
  flash comparator goes up exponentially with the number of comparators 
  required, and they are rarely seen over 16 bits. Multiple flash comparators 
  can be cascaded together, however. The great advantage of flash ADCs is that 
  they are extremely fast, effectively real time. The only limit on their speed 
  is the slew-rate of the comparators used to construct them. Because of this, 
  they easily reach over 1 million samples per second. </LI></UL>

be referring to a successive approximation type ADC.</B></P>

<P>This should give you a good idea of the process the DAC uses to arrive at an 
output value.</P>
<HR>

<H3>Circuitry</H3>
<P>The following schematic is an example of a minimal ADC.</P>
<P><IMG height=484 alt="ADC Schematic" src="adc_schematic.gif" 
width=668></P>
<P>There is one part of this schematic that we haven't discussed, and that is 
the <STRONG>sample &amp; hold</STRONG> circuitry. When the analog to digital 
conversion takes place, the DAC output is compared to the voltage across the 
S&amp;H capacitor rather than comparing the output of the DAC to the input 
voltage directly. This isolates the DAC from the input voltage, and prevents the 
conversion process from getting messed up if the input voltage swings widely. 
The ADC controller signals the switch to close for a predetermined amount of 
time to allow the cap to charge up to the input voltage. It then opens the 
switch, and begins the ADC process. Although the cap does discharge very 
slightly during the ADC process, it is negligible, due to the comparator's very 
high input impedance. The 10v source is simply a reference for the DAC. In this 
case, it's output will vary between 0 and 10 volts, thus limiting the measurable 
input voltage range to 0 to 10 volts. By changing the reference voltage on the 
DAC, the effective input voltage range can also be changed.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>The Logic Controller</STRONG></P>
<P>The logic controller is best described by this snippit of C code, which uses 
a PC as the logic controller and the parallel port as the interface to the ADC 
circuit.</P><PRE>#include &lt;conio.h&gt;

<H3>The ADC In Action</H3>
<P align=center><IMG src="lab_wide.jpg"></P>
<P>One of the most infamous labs in the VTC Computer System Components and 
Interfaces EL-203 course is the Successive Approximation ADC lab. In this lab we 
essentially construct the circuit above, except that we use a PC and the 
parallel port as the ADC Logic controller. Here is some media from that lab.</P>
<P><A href="lab.jpg"><IMG 
src="lab_small.jpg" border=0></A></P>
<P><A href="lab.jpg">Click here to 
see a close up of the circuit in action.</A></P>
<P><A href="d_to_a.mpeg"><IMG 
src="digiscope_screen.gif" border=0></A></P>
<P><A href="d_to_a.mpeg">Click on the 
image above to see an animation of the DAC waveform.</A> This is the output from 
the DAC for an input voltage of about 3.8 volts. The change in the output 
voltage as the controller sets and clears the bits is clearly visible. Because 
the ADC is so precise, it is difficult to see them all, but you can count about 
9 equally sized time steps in the waveform. 8 are for the conversion, and the 
final step is for the output. You will notice that the scope is operating at a 
timebase of 50 microseconds per division. The whole ADC process takes only 350 
microseconds.</P>
<P><IMG src="analyzer_screen.gif"></P>
<P>This is the input to the DAC, which of course is also the output from the 
ADC. CLEARLY visible are the bits as they are set and cleared. The bottom most 
waveform, #08, is the signal to the sample &amp; hold switch. #07 is the most 
significant bit, and #00 is the least significant bit. Notice how each bit from 
the MSB to the LSB is set, and then some are cleared and some are not.</P>
